Oh, and here's a great quote from this Wikipedia on
[salted duck eggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salted_duck_egg).

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck

You can also write code blocks here!

### Javascript code

```javascript
// program to generate a multiplication table

// take input from the user
const number = parseInt(prompt('Enter an integer: '))

//creating a multiplication table
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  // multiply i with number
  const result = i * number

  // display the result
  console.log(`${number} * ${i} = ${result}`)
}
```

### Java code

```java
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    int n = 10, firstTerm = 0, secondTerm = 1;
    System.out.println("Fibonacci Series till " + n + " terms:");

    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
      System.out.print(firstTerm + ", ");

      // compute the next term
      int nextTerm = firstTerm + secondTerm;
      firstTerm = secondTerm;
      secondTerm = nextTerm;
    }
  }
}
```

### Python code

```python
# Python program to find the factorial of a number provided by the user.

# change the value for a different result
num = 7

# To take input from the user
#num = int(input("Enter a number: "))

factorial = 1

# check if the number is negative, positive or zero
if num < 0:
   print("Sorry, factorial does not exist for negative numbers")
elif num == 0:
   print("The factorial of 0 is 1")
else:
   for i in range(1,num + 1):
       factorial = factorial*i
   print("The factorial of",num,"is",factorial)
```
